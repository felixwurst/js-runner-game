### Description:

A game in which the player has to jump over the boxes coming towards him by pressing the space key. For each successful jump you get one point. As soon as the player touches one of the boxes the game is over.
Canvas is used for the game. The movement of the player is generated similar to a flip-book. The different sequences are part of a picture and while the game is running the cutout is moved.

### Exercise:

Increase the speed at which the box approaches after each successful jump.
